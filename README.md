TO DO

## Additional notes
* currently not saving a trained model as training is still ongoing
* will use a different dataset in the future, possibly from [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/)

### Some things to try
* make custom discriminator and generator models smaller (less deep)
* use VGG16 classifier instead of a custom discriminator model
* use lower resolution images as the input to the generator, and upsample more over training
* use a ProGAN approach to model design
